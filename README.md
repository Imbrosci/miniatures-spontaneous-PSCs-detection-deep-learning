# Spontaneous and miniatures postsynaptic currents (PSCs) detection

### This repository provides an algorithm to automate the detection of miniatures (mPSCs) and spontaneous (sPSCs) inward postsynaptic currents in neurophysiological patch-clamp recordings. The algorithm mainly rilies on a deep learning model built using Tensorflow which was trained on both mPSCs and sPSCs from voltage-clamp recordings.

The model is currently under revision. Once the revision will be finished, a detailed explanation on how to use it will follow.
