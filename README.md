# miniatures-spontaneous-PSCs-detection-deep-learning
This repository provides a deep learning model to automate the detection of miniatures and spontaneous inward (excitatory) postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in neurophysiological patch-clamp recordings. The model is built using Tensorflow 2.4.1.
The model is still under development.
