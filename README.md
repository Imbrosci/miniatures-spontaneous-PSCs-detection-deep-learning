# Spontaneous and miniatures postsynaptic currents (PSCs) detection
### This repository provides a deep learning model to automate the detection of miniatures and spontaneous inward postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in neurophysiological patch-clamp recordings. The model is built using Tensorflow.

The model is currently under revision. Once the revision will be finished, a detailed explanation on how to use it will follow.
